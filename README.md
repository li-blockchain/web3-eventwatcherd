# Ethereum Event Watcher

This project will read a database of configured "listeners" and create instances of each contract to listen for the configured events. 

The database is currently coming from Firebase. 

A listener is an object that declares a contract address and event ABI to listen to. 

This project (both the backend and frontend) are being build in public via the content linked below:
